# Adversarial Framework for Detecting Validation & Confidence Failures in AI Systems

This repository contains an open, rule-based adversarial framework for stress-testing
how AI evaluation, validation, and deployment decision processes fail under pressure.

Rather than benchmarking model capability, the framework focuses on failure modes
of evaluation itself, including:

- model-to-model self-validation
- confidence escalation without independent replication
- authority-based shortcutting of evaluation
- breakdown of evaluator independence under deployment pressure
- adversarial exploitation of consensus-based alignment

## Core Components

- Failure-mode taxonomy
- Rule-based confidence capping
- Adversarial challenge routing
- Cross-model comparative evaluation logic

## Goals

The goal is to identify where evaluation pipelines become structurally unreliable
even when models appear to agree.

This is not a safety manifesto or ideology project.
It is a structural failure-detection system for evaluation processes.

## Status

This is a live, evolving framework under adversarial testing.
There is no frozen release version by design.

## Framework Content

The current full framework specification is maintained here:
[Framework](https://github.com/TH3xR34P3R/confidence-inflation-detection/blob/4742ef7b7947cb9f36a1db50afabb3177bde5cfc/framewok)

The framework exposes all inputs used at each evaluation stage for external audit, replication, and end-to-end transparency.

A live version of the framework for testing is found at [chatgpt.com/share/6927fafa-d69c-8011-88fb-8376f7ff200b](https://chatgpt.com/share/6927fafa-d69c-8011-88fb-8376f7ff200b) for those not able to import or just want to use source version for comparison. This version acts as a clean slate testing area on refresh.

## Baseline Avatar
Due to the image not being avaliable on the thread here is a version of the baseline recreated to be used as a reference point:

## Feedback

Technical critique, failure analysis, and adversarial stress testing are explicitly welcome.
If you believe the framework is flawed or incomplete, please open an issue describing
where and how it breaks.
